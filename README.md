## Project Introduction
  People often experience boredom and decreased concentration during prolonged periods of solitary work and study. This common issue not only affects productivity but also impacts mental well-being, potentially leading to stress and reduced learning efficiency.  

  Our goal is to develop a cat bot which has two modes: one is focus mode, in which the cat bot does not make any sound or move, only subtle facial expressions
The other is the interaction mode, in which the cat bot will have rich facial expressions and behaviors.  

  We hope to switch between these two modes through timed alarms, using focus mode when people need to focus on work or study. After a fixed period of time, the cat bot will sound an alarm to remind people to rest and interact with them.
